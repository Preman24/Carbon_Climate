2008,"""All inclusive"" Feed-in Tariff for small renewable energy power plants",ITA,Italy,"Electricity and heat, Renewables","The Decree of 11 April 2008 lays down the criteria to stimulate the production of electricity from solar thermodynamic plants, including the hybrid ones, connected to the electricity grid, built in Italy. Plants must be equipped with thermal accumulation systems. On top of the selling price, net electricity produced by thermodynamic solar plants commissioned after 18 July 2008 can obtain a feed-in premium for 25 years. Up to 2012 the bonus varies from EUR 0.22 to EUR 0.28 / kWh depending on the level of integration of the plants. In case of hybrid plants, the feed-in tariff decreases depending on the ratio between the amount of energy not produced by a solar energy source and the amount produced by a solar energy source. The maximum cumulative power of all solar thermodynamic plants eligible for the incentives corresponds to 1.5 million m2 of cumulative surface. The national objective of total power to be installed by 2016 corresponds to 2 million m2 of cumulative surface. For the 2013-2014 period such bonus values will be reduced by 2% a year; from 2014 onward special Ministerial Decree will define further cuts.

""Based on the policies stipulated in the Strategic Energy Plan, which the Cabinet approved in April 2014, METI established the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Subcommittee under the Strategic Policy Committee of the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy in order to consider a future vision of a realistic, yet well-balanced energy supply and demand structure. So far, a total of 11 meetings on these matters have been held.
""METI has approved the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook based on the report compiled by the subcommittee.""
The energy and demand outlook for 2030 serves as de facto energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. For renewable energy, it is described that Japan will aim to increase the share of renewables in total electricity generation to 22-24% by 2030. For energy efficiency, it is described that Japan will aim to reduce its final energy use by about 10%, from 361 million kl crude oil equivalent (coe) in 2010 to 326 million kl coe in 2030.
Original title: ????????????. For the primary energy supply, the envision structure for FY2030 is as follows: renewables 13-14%,Nuclear power: 10-11%, Natural gas: 18%, Coal: 25%, LPG: 3%, Oil 30%. For the power source mix, the structure is for FY2030 is as follows: Renewables: 22-24%, Nuclear power 20-22%, LNG: 27%, Coal: 26%, Oil 3%. Renewables are divided into: Geothermal: 1-1.1%; Biomass: 3.7-4.6%, Wind: 1.7%; Solar: 7%; Hydro: 8.8-9.2%. With a projection of economic growth at 1.7%/year, energy efficiency and conservation measures are also expected to allow a 196.1 bn kWh reduction (reduction of 17%).
Japan's INDC is developed based on this Long-Term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook.

The targets set for 2030 are as follows:
- Double the energy self-sufficiency ratio (18% at present, including nuclear power generation) and the domestically-developed fossil fuel supply ratio* (26% at present), and raise the energy independence ratio to about 70 percent from the present 38 percent.
*The ratio of fossil fuel supply from domestic and overseas interests that a Japanese company has a share in the total supply
- Raise the ratio of energy from zero-emission power sources such as nuclear and renewable energy to 70 percent (by more than 50% in 2020) from the present 34%. For this purpose:
Build more than 14 additional nuclear plants (nine by 2020).
Raise the overall plant capacity utilization rate to 90 percent (85% by 2020) from the 60% in 2008.
Maximize the use of renewable energy.
Cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the residential sector by half.
Maintain and raise energy efficiency in the industrial sector to the highest level in the world.
Maintain or achieve top-level shares of global markets for energy-related products and systems.
According to the plan, the goal is to reduce domestic energy-related CO2 emissions by 30 percent in 2030 compared to the 1990 level. Its intention was to increase nuclear energy in the mix to raise Japan's level of energy self-sufficiency, on the assumption this would also enhance energy security. (Although Japan imports all the uranium it needs for nuclear power generation, nuclear power was deemed a ""quasi-domestic energy"" because the government considers it possible to recycle nuclear fuel at home, if the nuclear fuel cycle is based on reprocessing used fuel and using it in fast-breeder reactors.)

The ETS will start with the electricity sector covering around 3.5 Gt CO2 emissions (Stavins, 2017) and is expected to start in 2020 (China Carbon Forum, 2017). After that, gradually other industry sectors, such as cement, steel, petroleum refining and chemicals will be added to the program. The ETS targets is not an absolute emissions gap, but a rate based (CO2/Kwh) cap that is set per category per sector. The rate is based on historical trends and technology benchmarks (Stavins, 2017). For example, coal-fired power plants are expected to have different rates, than gas-fired power plants. In the beginning, the permits of this scheme will be grandfathered to the firms, in this case plants emitting more than 26,000 tonnes of CO2 per year (Carbon Brief, 2017).
Updates in 2024:
Expansion of sectors: China plans to include cement, steel, and electrolytic aluminium industries in its national carbon trading system, starting in 2024. This will increase the ETS coverage from 40% to about 60% of China's total CO2 emissions.

The Plan’s objective is to prepare the country’s industry for the new future scenario that is emerging in the horizon, in which carbon productivity, equivalent to the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions per product unit, will be as important as work productivity and other productive factors in defining the international competitiveness of Brazilian industry. In order to do that, it will be necessary to establish management systems for the greenhouse gas emission of the industrial sector as tools to improve competitiveness, in a process similar to the implementation of environmental management systems in the past.
“The design and implementation of the sector plan is based on the rules established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and do not affect the ongoing validity of such rules, including the commitment with international financial and technological support for the actions of countries not included in Annex and flexibilities for them with regard to measurement, communication and verification of emissions and emission reductions.
“The Industry Plan is based on three pillars:
(i) Gradual implementation of a measurement, reporting and verification system (MRV) for the emission of greenhouse gases produced by industrial activities.
(ii) Action Plan with a set of measures and instruments to encourage emission reductions.
(iii) Creation of an Industry Plan Technical Commission (CTPIn) comprising representatives of the government, industry, civil society and academia, responsible for detailing the Plan’s actions, monitoring and periodical reviews.
“The Industry Plan adopts as reference a 5% reduction target for emissions in industrial processes and energy use in the industrial sector, in relation to the trend scenario (Business As Usual) projected for 2020. The target’s role is to stimulate improvements to the efficiency of industrial processes and not to hinder economic growth.”

The costly forest concession, through the payment for the sustainable use of forest products and services, is a way of indirect management that can be applied to National Forests and other types of public forests which are not designated to community use or protected areas of ""full protection"" category. Thus allowing federal, state and local governments to grant to private actors the right to sustainably exploit the goods and services present in public forests. It is worth highlighting the fact that this law does not allow the commercialization of carbon credits and other environmental services by the owner of the concession, as explained in art. 16, 1st paragraph of section VI.
The Brazilian government currently implements a concession policy to exploit timber harvesting on national forestry reserves. The law creates a Brazilian Forest Service, sets up a National Forest Development Fund and puts into effect an infrastructure for sustainable use of public lands (including the use of concessions). The law aims to strengthen forest conservation (especially in the
Amazon) by decreasing land speculation, putting an end to fraudulent property claims (grilagem) and creating a socially inclusive, sustainable forest-based economy.

2011,Rajasthan Solar Policy,IND,India,Electricity and heat,"The state of Rajasthan is endowed with the highest radiation levels in India and implemented the Solar Policy to harness great untapped resources and meet its Renewable Portfolio Standard requirements. The state targets the installation of 1 to 1.2 GW of solar capacity by 2022, seeks to enhance energy security, create jobs in the solar manufacturing and become a main exporter of renewable power to third party and neighboring states. To reach such targets, the solar policy includes a combination of support tools: First, power producers are exempted from electricity duty on the energy they consume and can apply for incentives under the Industry Scheme. Producers of solar thermal energy are granted access to the water quantity required for generation by local authorities and solar power will be guaranteed grid access under both the Indian Solar Mission and the Rajasthan Solar policy. The solar policy seeks to widespread the installation of solar water heating systems on all industrial buildings where hot water is required, large residential buildings, government and private hospitals, hotels and swimming pools. Solar steam systems in residential institutions and hospitals will also be supported. Second, the solar policy creates the RE infrastructure Development Fund to finance transmission network extension, road construction and ease the integration of RE generation. Such Fund will be financed by the collection of a development charge of INR. 10 Lacs per MW installed transfered to the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation. The policy also provides for the regulation framework to develop solar parks larger than 1, 000 MW capacity. Such Parks will include Solar Power Plants, Manufacturing Zones, R & D and Training Centres. Third, the Solar Policy creates the Solar Research Center of excellence. The solar policy will fulfill Rajasthan s engagements in the National Solar Mission -install 66 MW of solar capacity- and install additional capacity following a competitive bidding process. Central government will tender 50 MW of solar PV and 50 MW of solar thermal and best bidders will be guaranteed a fixed price by Discoms of Rajasthan.

2018,Regulations to address methane in the oil and gas sector,CAN,Canada,"Industry, Fossil fuel exploration and production","Aims to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025.
These outcome-focused regulations apply to upstream oil and gas facilities, which are responsible for extraction, production, processing and transportation of crude oil and natural gas. The requirements target two key methane sources: fugitive emissions, which are unintentional leaks from equipment leaks, and venting emissions, which are intentional releases of methane into the air.
General requirements apply to all covered upstream oil and gas facilities:
Compressors: As of January 1, 2020, covered compressors will be required to take action to conserve or destroy methane, or else to meet applicable vent limits. If a company opts not to conserve or destroy methane, it must demonstrate compliance with the limits via an annual measurement or continuous monitoring. Corrective action is required if those emissions exceed the limit applicable to the compressor, which depends on the installation date, the type of compressor, and its rated brake power.
Well completions involving hydraulic fracturing: As of January 1, 2020, these sites must conserve or destroy gas in most circumstances instead of venting it into the air.
Conditional requirements apply to covered upstream oil and gas facilities handling significant volumes (at least 60,000 cubic metres/year of gas):
Fugitive equipment leaks: As of January 1, 2020, upstream oil and gas facilities are required to start implementation of leak detection and repair program consisting of three comprehensive inspections per year at most upstream oil and gas facilities. Corrective action is required if leaks are discovered.
Facility production venting: As of January 1, 2023, upstream oil and gas facilities must limit annual facility vented volumes of methane to 15,000 m3. These facilities would need to capture the gas and either use it onsite, re-inject it underground, send it to a sales pipeline, or route it to a destruction device. This requirement does not apply to vented gas from:
-specific temporary activities such as emergencies, liquids unloading, or equipment start-ups, shutdowns, and blowdowns;
-facilities that have vented less than 40,000 m3 in the past year without destroying or selling or re-injecting any gas; and
-processing equipment such as glycol dehydrators, compressors and pneumatic devices.
Pneumatic devices:
-Controllers: As of January 1, 2023, facilities using natural-gas-powered pneumatic controllers must ensure that on-going emissions remain below 0.17m³ per hour.
-Pumps: As of January 1, 2023, pneumatic pumps are prohibited from emitting methane where the volume of liquid being pumped exceeds 20 litres per day.

The subsidy in 2006 was CNY 1373 per MT of fuel ethanol produced. Starting in 2002, most fuel ethanol produced was grain-based. However, a moratorium on such ethanol plants was imposed as of December 2006 by the NDRC and Ministry of Finance, lasting for a year and a half.
The government's policy was to substitute non-grain ethanol for grain ethanol, and not to compete with food requirements. IEA/IRENA Global Renewable Energy Policies and Measures Database © OECD/IEA and IRENA, [November 2020]",Mitigation,CN

Since effective actions consistent with national plans and targets, are needed in the power sector, promote the development of a sector-wide framework in which;
?The goals are consistent with national plans
?Main business operators including non-regional electric utilities are participating
?Responsible body is clearly defined (focusing on retail stage)
2. Treatment of CO2 within environmental assessment
Evaluate from a stand point below where necessary and reasonable
(a) Adoption of BATs (Best Available Technologies)
?The government will identify and publish “Development and commercialization status of cutting-edge power generation technologies” by size and by fuel types, as s reference for business operators’ consideration and will request business operators to adopt BATs
(b) Consistency with national targets and plans
b-1: In relation to mid-term target?If the business operator takes actions under the sector-wide framework or plans to take measures including mitigation in abroad to offset the net increase emission over a natural gas power plant, it is judged as consistent with national targets and plans.
b-2: In relation to 2050 target?The government will accelerate development of the technologies which is targeted to be commercialized by around 2020, conduct survey on potential CO2 storage sites as a prerequisite for CCS, identify requirements for CCS Ready plants, and request business operators to study continuously including technological development in order to put carbon capture facilities towards commercialization.

Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordinate climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards; adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides; research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited).
The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector.
Targets outlined in this legislation include:
– 40% GHGs from non-ETS sectors by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels)
– 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020
– 20% more efficient energy use (compared to 2008)

The Law introduces several development schemes for the private development of renewable energy projects, including competitive bids, feed-in tariff, and independent power production through third party access.
Competitive bidding to be run by the New and Renewable Energy Authority (“NREA”) open to private sector companies for construction of the renewable power projects. Constructed stations will be operated by NREA. Produced electricity will be sold to Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) at a regulated price determined by Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency (ERA).
Competitive bidding mechanism for build-own-operate (BOO) contracts to be run by EETC and open to private companies for construction, ownership and operation of the renewable power projects. Generated electricity will be sold to EETC on the price agreed between EETC and plant owner.
Feed-in tariff (FIT) support system under which private sector investors are allowed to build, own and operate renewable energy power stations and sell generated electricity to EETC or to licensed distribution companies via power purchase agreements (PPA). PPA determines duration of the contract and a fix electricity price (feed-in tariff). PPA for feed-in tariffs for solar installations will last 20 years, for wind projects 25 years. Egypt aims to deploy 4300 MW of new renewable capacity under FIT scheme between 2015 and 2017. FIT system is open only for solar PV and wind technologies.
Independent power production through third party access scheme allows independent power producers (IPP) to enter bilateral electricity purchase contracts with eligible consumers and sell them produced electricity directly.

A solid district heating network, fed by renewable heat from biomass, will be the main motor of the energy transition in the heating sector.
Full independence from fossil fuels will also be reached through a solid and long term energy efficiency policy aiming at reducing gross energy consumption by 6% from 2006 levels. Energy companies will be required to increase energy savings by 50% in 2013 and 75% by 2017 to 2020. Electric meters diffusion will participate in moniotring energy demand in the residential sector.

The new renewable energy law establishes more ambitious national renewable energy targets that should reach 20% of total national energy consumption and 40% of total electricity consumption by 2020. Moreover, 20% of energy used in heating and cooling and 10% of energy used in transportation have to come from renewable sources. The new legislation foresees the creation of a Special Renewable Energy Investment Service that will act as an interface between public institutions and investors, annually assess the main challenges to renewable energy deployment and manage the support funding allocation process. Existing remuneration of individual residents in areas where renewable energy projects are running have been amended and replaced by a credit on electricity bills. In fact, the law establishes that a share of the RE concession taxes paid by RE producers to regional and local authorities will will be allocated to local households as a credit on their electricity bill as a way to share the benefits of living nearby a renewable energy generation plant. The renewable energy generation licensing process has also been very much fasten and eased by the regulation that entitles the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) with the assessment and issuance of licences, under the authority of the ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. The whole licensing process can not last over a 30-month period. Moreover, absolute priority is given to RES projects combined with desalination plants, when and only when the RES project is on an island and its capacity does not exceed 25% of the capacity of the desalination plant. The law also tackles the grid infrastructure challenge and implements a timely limited target for the grid utility to connect non-interconnected islands to the main grid. Still, RE projects are not granted grid priority access as grid connection will be established on a first-come first served basis until the network is saturated. The grid utility is compelled to provide grid access within four months after the connection demand has been released.

The plan aims to cut energy consumption per unit of GDP by 3-5% per year. It also aims at increasing the share of renewable energy to 16% by 2030, and transport fuel from alternative sources such as gas or biofuels to 20% by 2020. The plan contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech Republic, including projections of future development, and presents proposals for concrete measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and for adaptation measures. The programme was reviewed in 2007, and the review adopted by the government in April 2008. The review pointed to significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources, as well as progress in the agriculture and water management sectors. However, it found the Czech Republics energy intensity and GHG emissions per capita were comparatively high, and that transport sector emissions continued to increase. The National Climate Change Plan is thus being reviewed to emphasise measures targeting the industry and transport sectors, which contribute the most to GHG emissions, as well as to take into account the evolution of domestic, European and global political negotiations on climate change since 2004.

The current New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy 2011 – 2016 was released simultaneously with the Energy Strategy.
The current Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy's focus is on promoting energy efficiency, energy conservation and renewable energy. It is prepared in accordance with the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2000 and is in force for a period of five years.
In addition to an economy-wide target to continue to achieve a rate of energy intensity improvement of 1.3 percent per annum the Conservation Strategy sets out objectives for six sectors:
Transport: a more energy-efficient transport system, with a greater diversity of fuels and alternative energy technologies
Business: enhanced business growth and competitiveness resulting from energy intensity improvements
Housing: warm, dry and energy-efficient homes with improved air quality to avoid ill-health and lost productivity
Products: greater business and consumer uptake of energy-efficient products

Main objective of the Algerian Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Development Plan is to expand usage of renewable energies and to diversify energy sources in the country.
Goals:
To install 22 000 MW of power generating capacity from renewable sources between 2011 and 2030 (of which 12 000 for internal usage and 10 000 MW for export);
To meet 20% of electricity generation from renewables by 2030
Renewable energy development will drive sustainable economic development of the country, increase energy security supply in Algeria and will have job-creation factor;
Solar energy (both solar PV and solar thermal) is recognized by the Algerian government as a primary renewable technology to be developed. The potential for wind, biomass, geothermal and hydropower energies is comparatively very small.
Combined, Algeria hopes to have more than 22 GW of renewable energy capacity installed by 2030, and has targeted the connection of 4.5 GW by 2020. Should Algeria hit its target, renewable energy would by 2030 account for 27% of the nation’s power outpout, offsetting the need for 22 GW of natural gas generation.

NDC’s implementation timeframe spans from 2020 to 2030. In this scenario, 991 MtCO2e were quantified in 2030. They posited an unconditional contribution to reduce 22% of GHG emissions and a conditional contribution of up to 36% reduction below BAU, 774 MtCO2 and 638 MtCO2, respectively (Climate Action Tracker, 2020).
Mexico plans to cover all sectors. In a cross sectoral approach, the main measures outlined are Emission Trade System; Climate Finance Strategy, Circular Economy, Efficient Use of Energy. In the transport sector, Mexico aims the strengthening of regulations applicable to motor vehicles, the encouragement of alternative transportation systems, the promotion of clean transportation programs, the development and implementation of the National Electric Mobility Strategy and urban planning. In the electricity sector, it aims to increase participation of renewables, storage and smarter grids. Additionally, in the building sector the focus is on projects that optimize energy consumption in buildings and reduce the impacts of new constructions; to promote mechanisms and regulations that encourage the inclusion of best practices in constructions. Energy efficiency and circular economy are the kernel for the industrial sector.
According to Climate Action Tracker (2020), although both conditional and unconditional remained unchanged from Mexico’s 2016 NDC, its emission projections under BAU has been revised upwards. Therefore, the mitigation ambition has decreased.

2020,Nationally Determined Contribution - NDC,CUB,Cuba,General,"The updated Cuba’s NDC presents a plan of action to reduce GHG emissions by 2030 in several sectors. For that, Cuba chose to use a variable reference year according to the action posited, ranging from 2014 (e.g. electricity generation based on Renewables) to 2020 (decrease of GHG in swine industry).
Some tasks are underscored, such as the urban planning, reforestation, increase the perception of population and mitigation/adaptation in core sectors.
The Specific Objective 11 and 15 are both related with mitigation practices, the former focusing on to increase energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources and the latter to Implement economic incentives (taxes, tariffs, credits and others) to achieve financial sustainability in the use and preservation of natural and environmental resources (Cuba NDC, 2020).
The plan encompasses all sectors (general) and touches upon all the mitigation areas analysed. A Climate Finance strategy, energy efficiency, urban planning and direct investments are measures that overarch all sectors aiming a reduction of carbon emissions. In the electricity sector, specifically, the focus is on augmenting the share of renewables and in the building in set standards, relying on solar panels both in residential and industrial areas. The novelty in this document when compared with the 2016 NDC is the inclusion of contributions on transportation, inciting a switch to less intensive or electric cars and forestry (Cuba NDC, 2020).
Cuba aims to increase 24% the energy generation with renewables by 2030 supported by direct investments from the government. Also, Cuba posits to increase energy efficiency, diminishing the use of fossil fuel in buildings and transportation by installation of solar heaters, LED lamps, induction cookers and fuel switch to a less intensive and e-mobile.

The reference year chosen is 2010 and the BAU measured is 51 milGgCO2.
The country posited 46 Mitigation options in Transport, electricity, industry, agriculture and forestry sector, and also adaptation options. The policy instruments overarch all the sectors and mitigation areas. Special attention to fuel switch and investment in renewables in electricity, transport and industry sectors. Also, codes and standards for a less demand and more material efficiency are the base for the building sector, but also present in electricity and transport. Additionally, biomass is incited as a fuel rather than fossils in the industry and agriculture sector (Dominican Republic NDC, 2020).
The main policy instruments are possible to cite the economic strategic planning (Plan DECCC-2011 and Ley-1-12) and the Climate Change National policy (Decree 269-15 – PNCC 2015). Also, in the transport sector it is planned to set codes and standards to reduce GHG emissions (e.g. resource efficiency area – new lines, new modals, low carbon tech and electric cars). In the electricity sector the efforts are to increase the share of renewables (wind, solar and PCH) and fuel switch to a less intensive. In the building sector, Dominican Republic wants to improve energy efficiency (codes and standards visioning more efficiency) and resource efficiency to reduce the demand of energy, set new standards to introduce efficient lighting for public and residential areas. In addition, in the industry sector standards will be set for the acquisition of industrial electric motors and in biomass to replace fossil fuel.  Reforestation is also envisioned by the country.

Costa Rica tackles several sectors, establishing goals to achieve 8% of the country's fleet with zero emissions and also 8% of electric cars by 2030.
In the electricity and heat sector, it supports renewable energy (100% by 2030). Also, codes and standards are set aiming for energy efficiency of end users’ devices and a fuel switch is promoted by a moratorium on exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels.
The building sector is tackled with codes and standards driving for a more sustainable construction and material efficiency. Moreover, in the industry sector, renewable and low carbon energy are supported to move away from carbon-based production and towards a circular economy. Fiscal, tariffs and other price instruments are the base to support the forestry sector in order to achieve 60% of forest cover in the country without jeopardising the agricultural sector (Costa Rica NDC, 2020).
According to CAT, Costa Rica’s updated NDC has unconditional targets +2°C compatible. There is room for improvement by specifying the sectoral breakdown or the contribution of the forestry sector, and also by pushing for bolder goals in order to be 1.5°C compatible. CAT calculations show that when excluding LULUCF the total emissions in 2030 will be 12.3 to 12.9 MtCO2e in 2030, though there is some uncertainty due to the forestry contribution (Carbon Action Tracker, 2021).

2020,Nationally Determined Contribution - NDC,SEN,Senegal,General,"Senegal’s NDC has an unconditional and conditional target, depending on international aid. It is based in a BAU scenario taking into account 2010 as base year.
Senegal posits its mitigation by establishing 2025 as middle point and 2030 as the end point. The numbers are as follow: (i) In the reference year, a projection of emissions to 2025 (32648,6097 GgCO2eq) and 2030 (37761,1405 GgCO2eq) were foreseen; (ii) In the unconditional scenario, Senegal proposes reductions of 5% (30987 GgCO2eq) and 7% (35106 GgCO2eq) respectivaly to 2025 and 2030 emissions; (iii) In the conditional scenario, the goals are bolder, reaching 23,78% (24883,0564 GgCO2eq) in 2025 and 25,53% (26611,0057 GgCO2eq) in 2030.
The main policy instrument to be set is the carbon market and the main sector to be tackled is the electricity and power, shifting to renewables and for less intensive fuel (e.g. from oil to natural gas) (Senegal NDC, 2020).
The country aims to go an extra mile with international aid mainly in the electricity sector, outlining an unconditional achievement of a cumulative installed solar capacity of 235 MW, 150MW in wind power, 314 MW in hydroelectricity in 2030 and presents a conditional one of an additional solar capacity of 100 MW, 100 MW in wind power, 50 MW of biomass, 50 MW of CSP, by 2030. Moreover, Senegal has a wider goal to reach 999 MW in renewable energies (conditionally) and invest to switch carbon intensive fuels to natural gas in dual thermal power stations (fuel oil / gas), which will bring the total installed 600 MW of natural gas between 2025 and 2030.

The NDC sets an unconditional target of 95 MtCO2e by 2030. Also included 2025 as the peak year and a cap of emissions in the current decade of 1100MtCO2e.
For the LULUCF sector, Chile focuses on forest restoration, afforestation and reducing deforestation as carbon sink. The final goal is to reach neutrality by 2050.
Chile planns to strengthen its policy legal framework, exchange technology with international actors and build capacity through education at national level. Also, public-private alliances are supported by the government to finance action. In the building sector, Chile relies on targets, codes and standards and in the transport envisages to incite e-mobility and hydrogen to replace diesel. Fuel switching is also the way forward in the industry sector, from coal to electricity and biogas besides an increment in the efficiency. In the electricity sector, Chile wants to reduce GHG emission by phasing-out mineral coal, shifting to thermal and solar electrification (Chile NDC, 2020).
According to CAT this updated NDC still is insufficient to comply with Paris Agreement goals. However, this NDC is stronger than the previous, establishing 95 MtCO2e in 2030 as a wider goal, having the peak of emissions in 2025 followed by a downward trend until net-zero in 2050 and a smaller emission budget until 2030. Also, Chile establishes a target in the forestry sector.

Regarding long-term strategy, from 2021 onwards Brazil states it requires US$ 10 billion per year to realize environmental pledges, including conservation of native vegetation and states that the function of market mechanisms is paramount to achieve carbon neutrality earlier than 2060.
According to CAT, the Brazilian updated NDC is weaker than the previous one, being rated 'Highly insufficient"". The CAT shows that an increase in the emissions used as reference data allows Brazil to increase its emissions over than 400 MtCO2e still meeting the relative proposed target (1,453 MtCO2e in 2025 and 1,307 in 2030).

This strategy has established targets in the five thematic sectors to be accomplished within a five-year timeline up to 2025.
The Household Sector has two targets. It aims to increase the number of household appliances subjected to Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) from six to ten. It also aims for the use of improved efficient biomass cookstoves at 50 per cent of all households currently using biomass cookstoves.
There are six targets to be met in the Building Sector. First, there should be 10% share of newly built floor area compliant with energy efficiency requirements in the total building stock from the current baseline of zero. Second, two per cent of the buildings should have adopted American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standards for energy efficiency of buildings, or equivalent. Third, energy loads due to lighting in public buildings will be reduced by 50 per cent. Fourth and fifth, 20 per cent of public buildings and 25 per cent of the affordable houses the government is planning to build should be green, respectively. Lastly, the sector should develop Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for buildings.
This strategy has also set two targets for the Industry and Agriculture Sector. The sector is expected to increase the number of energy audits carried out from the current 1,800 to 4,000. The sector is also expected to implement the recommended energy conservation measures to save 100 MW of power demand, 250 million litres of heavy fuel oil and 9 million litres of industrial diesel oil.
In the Transport Sector, three targets have been set. The first is the improvement of fuel economy. Increasing the share of electric vehicles in the transport sector has been identified as the second target, aiming to reach five per cent. Lastly, NEECS targets to increase the number of passengers using commuter trains from 116,000 to 150,000 per day.

2018,Resources for France Plan,FRA,France,General,"A five-year planning strategy called the Plan ressources pour la France (Resources for France Plan) aims to define and lessen the dependency on natural resources for production and growth.
The Loi relative à la transition énergétique pour la croissance verte (Energy transition for green growth law), a national framework strategy for 2015, incorporates the policy. Additionally, it is an endeavor to control and promote a circular economy. Minerals are one of the natural resources covered in the Resources for France plan. Despite not being a large producer of essential minerals, France has recognized since the 2010s that its needs are growing due to the energy transition and the digitalization. The strategy includes essential minerals because France is heavily dependent on imports.
The Comité pour les métaux stratégiques (COMES) and the Bureau de recherches géologiques et minières (BRGM) are tasked with doing a more thorough mapping of the requirements for essential minerals in relation to the energy transition.
The strategy also emphasizes recycling as a viable production technique for industrialized nations like France. It urges further investigation into secondary mineral resources.
The proposal also suggests incorporating sustainability standards into the chain of production for vital minerals. Reusing and recycling are viewed as an alternate method to guarantee a local, sustainable supply. The strategy does, however, draw attention to the necessity of a European initiative on social and environmental standards for mining.
The circular economy is supported by policy in part thanks to this five-year strategy. It takes into account the social and environmental effects of key minerals in addition to their economic and security repercussions. This strategy is being developed simultaneously at the national and regional levels; some of the goals outlined in the Resources for France plan are also included in the European Commission's adopted 2020 Circular Economy Action Plan.
